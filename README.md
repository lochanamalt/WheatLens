# WheatLens: Real Time Crop Monitoring Dashboard for Wheat

WheatLens is an web application designed to track and visualize crop development
over time. The platform integrates data from field imaging sensors—specifically Raspberry Pi RGB and NoIR camera and 
thermal camera data to monitor plot-level canopy temperature dynamics, and Vegetation Indices (VIs).

---

## Key System Features

* **Multi-Line Interactive VI Graphs:** Time-series line charts tracking canopy temperature and VIs.
Interactive legend isolates a specific plot's lifecycle with a single click.
* **Raw Sensor Data:** Organizes and catalogs daily image collections sourced from 
**Raspberry Pi Camera V2 (IMX219)** RGB and NoIR camera modules, **FLIR Lepton** thermal camera and **Melexis MLX90640** thermal camera.
* **Canopy segmented NDVI:** Utilizes semantic segmentation pipelines to isolate the crop canopy from background soil noise.
NDVI is then mapped by calculating the spectral reflectance data extracted from the camera sensors.

## System Architecture & Data Flow

The platform separates data ingestion, backend querying, and client-side visualization layers to optimize performance when handling dense historical seasonal datasets:

## Configuration & Installation

### Azure Web App Deployment

Change the `env` variable in the config.properties to `prod`.

Setup the following environment variables in your Azure Web app
```env
CONNECTION_STRING
INFLUX_URL
INFLUX_TOKEN
INFLUX_ORG
INFLUX_BUCKET
```

Go to the Deployment Center in Azure Web App and Connect to the GitHub Repository to Deploy. Pick the latest release branch for the deployment.

---
### 1. Python Backend Server Run Locally

Install the application's runtime dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The backend requires access to the cloud InfluxDB bucket instance and the Azure File Share
To run locally, find the config.properties file and include the configurations:

```env
env=dev
azure.connectionstring=<connection_string>
influxdb.url=<influxdb_url>
influxdb.org=<influxdb_organization_id>
influxdb.bucket=<influxdb_bucketname>
influxdb.token=<influxdb_token>
```
and boot up your local api development server


### 2. Angular Frontend Run Locally

Navigate to the frontend workspace container and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To boot up the application locally in standard development mode:

```bash
ng serve
```

Run below to compile production-ready static assets and copy the assists to  `/static` directory.

```bash
ng build --configuration production
```
